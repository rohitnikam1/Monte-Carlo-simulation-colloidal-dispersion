# Monte Carlo Simulation of Colloidal Dispersion

The project implements Monte Carlo (MC) method for simulating and studying the system of an electrostatically charged colloid with a salt. Premitive model of 1:1 electrolyte solution has been used to characterize electrostatic interactions among the particles (colloidal particles and ions). The electrostatic interactions are calculated using *Ewald summation*, which is a method for computing long-range interactions (e.g. electrostatic interactions) in computational chemistry. Ewald summation is a special case of the Poisson summation formula, replacing the summation of interaction energies in *real space* with an equivalent summation in *Fourier space*. In this method, the long-range interaction is divided into two parts: a short-range contribution, and a long-range contribution which does not have a singularity. The short-range contribution is calculated in **real space**, whereas the long-range contribution is calculated using a **Fourier transform**. The advantage of this method is the rapid convergence of the energy compared with that of a direct summation. This means that the method has high accuracy and reasonable speed when computing long-range interactions, and it is thus the de facto standard method for calculating long-range interactions in periodic systems. 

The total potential energy of the system is tracked as a function of the MC move of a randomly chosen particle. It is seen that the energy decreases exponentially during initial MC moves. The energy decreases and eventually reaches a plateau as the number of MC moves increases. Three systems have been studied -- (1) 2000 ions with 20 colloidal particles, (2) 1000 ions with 10 colloidal particles and (3) 100 ions with 1 colloidal particle.

Radial density distributions of oppositely charged ions around each colloidal particle are then calculated. For future work, these distributions can in principle be mapped to the Poisson-Boltzmann model for electrolyte distribution around oppositely charged colloidal particle. In addition, the Widom insertion method, which is a **statistical thermodynamic approach** to the calculation of material and mixture properties, is used to calculate the excess chemical potential of species.
